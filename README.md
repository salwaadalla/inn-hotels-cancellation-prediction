# INN Hotels Project

## Introduction

This project aims to address the challenge of high cancellation rates in the hospitality industry, specifically within the INN Hotels Group in Portugal. With the increasing trend of booking cancellations impacting hotel revenue and operational efficiency, a data-driven approach is necessary to predict and mitigate cancellations effectively.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can identify bookings likely to be canceled in advance. By analyzing various factors influencing cancellations, the model aims to assist INN Hotels in formulating strategies to minimize revenue loss and optimize guest experiences.

## Data Description

The dataset provided contains detailed attributes of customer booking information, including demographic details, booking characteristics, and historical booking behavior. The data is used to train machine learning models to predict booking cancellations.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

Based on the analysis conducted, several key insights and recommendations were identified to address the challenge of booking cancellations at INN Hotels:

1. **Lead Time and Special Requests**: Lead time and the number of special requests play a crucial role in predicting booking cancellations. Bookings with special requests made under 151 days to the arrival date are less likely to be canceled. Automated re-confirmation emails and reminders can help mitigate cancellations in such cases.

2. **Stricter Cancellation Policies**: Implementing stricter cancellation policies, especially for bookings with high average room prices and special requests, can reduce revenue loss. Consistent policies across all market segments, with less refund for online cancellations, are recommended.

3. **Length of Stay Restriction**: Limiting the length of stay to 5 days and allowing extensions only for Corporate and Aviation guests can streamline operations and reduce cancellations.

4. **Seasonal Trends**: December and January exhibit lower cancellation rates, likely due to holiday travel. Adequate staffing during these months is essential to ensure a seamless guest experience.

5. **Customer Loyalty Programs**: Implementing loyalty programs to incentivize repeat bookings and enhance customer experience can foster customer loyalty and reduce cancellations.

6. **Post-Booking Interaction**: Engaging customers post-booking with personalized communication and local event information can enhance guest satisfaction and reduce cancellations.
